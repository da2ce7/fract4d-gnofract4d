Orbits/Attractors

A new kind of formula which specifies a per-iteration function or set
of functions from a 4D point to another 4D point. Plot after each
iteration. Initially, ignore Z,W position - later, project to screen.

Or: use same functions, a separate drawing mechanism, plus a flag for
formula to set default. That could allow Buddhabrot-style
calculations on all types.

params (not all applicable to all types): 
1) how to set color of point
2) time step
3) which points to start with

Gnofract4d server:
Browse formulas, .fct files interactively in web browser, gf4d
gf4d fetch formulas automatically when missing
formulas are versioned, .fct file lists revision it used
local repository with versioning?
anyone can edit any formula, no-one can delete older revisions
all edits are attached to a named user. 
Anyone can create an account without human intervention
Post new formulas and .fct files easily from within GUI
Post thumbnail images for browsing

design possibilities:
use revision control system (subversion, cvs, rcs, arch?)
pysvn (has further dependencies)
hosting: cvsdude? sourceforge?
wiki? (need to remove formatting, though)
