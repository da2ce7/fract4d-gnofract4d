Must do pre 1.7
* W	finish cmapeditor
* W	update docs
* B	outer_cf not saved correctly - itercount changes to cont_potential

Done:
* B 	something wrong with zero'th iteration with manzpower - unroll-related

*		- Cursors : left/right/up/down
* W 	install all headers + template in make install + rpm
* W	move compiler_template back to proper dir
* BB	nova doesn't display correctly unless TRACE defined - weird!
	- starts working if no -O flags : g++ is broken
	- must also disable periodicity for all bailfuncs
* BBB	crash opening cmapbrowser when compiled with g++3. nova works though
* W	"compiling" progress message
* B	horrible_drawing_error has been observed to do weird shit - sometimes
* B	diff_bailout produces weird squares - like isTheSame doesn't work?
* BB 	weird graphical errors for some fractal types - fixed?
* W	profile number of threads: is > 2 better?
* B	why periodicity being used for skipped squares antialiasing?
* B	periodicity + newton doesn't work : see newt_bug.fct
* B	default params of newton are all black
* B	Newton doesn't work
* B	real(), imag() bailouts broken for quadratic - see quad_deepen_bug.fct. 
	Works when ALLPERIOD=1
* B	quadratic broken
* B	passing opts on command line changes saved params
* B	moving weirdness slider causes too many restarts - unusable
* BB 	fractal parameters don't work
* W	periodicity tolerance should be based on pixel size
* B	quadratic horribly slow too
* B	can't interrupt 8x8 squares, plus they don't multi-thread
* BBB	random glitches (usually horizontal lines). single-threaded is ok
* B	can't resize to smaller than toolbar or current size
* W	image size != window size (scrollable)
* W	for multi-proc aa on n procs, first do every nth row, then go back
	and fill in gaps - fewer cache clashes and more repeatable rendering 
* B	sometimes all work gets serialized to one thread
* B	failed nNoPeriodIters <= nMaxIters - due to race between flush() and last work items
* W	persistent user prefs, rather than per-fractal
* W	configuration (compiler location & flags, not saved with fractal)
* W	remove hack that looks for compiler_template locally
* W	persist settings across sessions
* B	crash if change compiler while calculating
* B	crash if couldn't compile
* B	remove inlined compiler_template
* B 	weird glitches in valley_test.fct
* W	lower priority for drawing threads?
* B	colormap browser previews are wrong
* B	periodicity makes low-count images like param.fct 2.5x slower
* B	SMP auto-deepening theoretically broken
* W	cache .so files
* W 	move parameters to compile-time, not runtime
* B	periodicity gives weird wrong pixels in bailed-out area
* W	removing mallocing from work queue
* B	Fixed recoloring
* W	Undo/Redo
* W	Online Help
* W	Documentation
* W	Update Screenshots
* B	Sometimes progress=1.0 is left at the end
* W	SMP rendering
* W	pause toolbar -> menu
* W	"deepen now" toolbar button
* B 	deepening black square bug
* B	can't set iterOpts using text entry any more
* W	parameterized types
* B	iter8 incorrect with non-magnitude bailout functions
* B	off-by-one on iter8? (eg 65 iters == 64 iters on previous version)
* W 	Different fractal types
* W	pause
* W	finish cmd-line arguments
* B	annoying precision message
* W	Session remembers last parameters
* B	Applying a colour sometimes moves image: properties not in sync?
* B 	do/undo printfs
* B	*.c -> *.cpp
* B	add docs to distribution
* B	CRASH in quit_cb (changes fract after fract is deleted) if exit 
	after calculation has finished
* W	Deepening...(n iters)
* W	grey undo/redo when not available
* W	create_angle_button : should be a widget
* W	better widget for antialias (slider?)
* W 	get rid of gnomenumberentries
* B	resize more nicely
* B	quit_cb isn't passed the right user_data so it can't interrupt. hmph.
* B	don't resize when toolbar comes/goes
* W	turn on/off auto-deepening
* B	Load/Save 
* B 	about from docs
* W	fractal widget
* W 	sort out sizing!
* W	move temporary files to /tmp

Mysteriously gone:
* B	nova crash
