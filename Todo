todo for 2.0
* BB	deeper.fct, hive.fct, image.fct doesn't load properly - old format
* BB	tower_of_thorns, untitled_5 don't load - need bailout for colorfunc

* BB	giger.fct
* BB	novamount.fct
* BB	seaslug.fct

done:
* B	default size for browser is too small

* B	set_initparam didn't trigger parameters-changed
* BB	load dubious.fct, undo/redo = gone, black screen instead
* B	shouldn't start drawing original before loading params on cmd-line
* BB	acos,acosh,asin,asinh,atan,atanh,cotan,cotanh give 'str not callable'
* B	selected func in fractal settings dlg not updated by undo/redo
* B	change func then undo causes problems
* W	compiler properties
* W	store user preferences

* WW	undo/redo
* B	reset messes up undo order?
* W	combine 2 classes in gtkfractal.py

* W	set size of diff_bailout check from periodicity info
* W	SMP/nthreads > 1
* B	exception if you open and choose OK without selecting a file

* WW	bailFuncs
* W	user parameter functions

postponed
* BB	novaspiral.fct - close enough
* WW	cmap browser
* W	autosave/restore?
* W	max size for .so cache
* W	diff bailout for other types
* W	logmap
* W	periodicity
* B	interrupt takes too long on deep-zoomed fractals
* W	signal tpool conds after releasing mutex?

* WW	register mime info?
* W	make it work with GMP
* W	faster GMP (get at internals during loop, maybe?)
* W	full-screen mode
* W 	desktop mode
* W 	demo mode
* WW	dirty/clean stuff won't work unless 
	- eject val / (scratch?) is kept freach point
	- can calc color without recalcing iter 
* W	bookmarks
* B	Mutants don't work at deep zooms
* W	fast single-undo
* WW	critical values + multiple basins/color schemes
* W	make sure inner function is sensible (itercount is pointless)
* WW	import .par files
* WW	import .upr files
* W	import ultrafractal gradient files
* WW	gimp gradient files:
GIMP Gradient

The format seems to be
start middle end [range 0...1]
R G B A left endpoint
R G B A right endpoint
type where type is one of linear (0), curved, sine,
sphere_increasing and sphere_decreasing
coloring, one of rgb, hsv_ccw, hsv_cw

The type & colouring are accessible to the gradient editor (the
user, I mean) in the "blending function for segment" and "Colouring 
type for segment" menus of the gradient editor menu.

This information is available in app/gradient.c and
app/gradient_header.h.

gnofract4d
* W	there is no warning before files are overwritten (parameter files +
	pictures)
* W	automatic addition of file extensions and
* W	automatic saving of picture and parameters at the same time

* B	image size should be persisted and kept under Preferences.
* B	aspect ratio locked with -i and -j params
