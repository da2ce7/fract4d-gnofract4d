* W	sort out fractal types a bit
* W 	Keyboard
*		- Cursors : left/right/up/down
* WW	MDI
* W	associate with file type?
* B	can't resize to smaller than toolbar or current size
* W	main toolbar: home, exit
* W	make it work with GMP
* W	faster GMP (get at internals during loop, maybe?)
* W	full-screen mode
* W 	desktop mode
* W 	demo mode
* W 	no-X mode
* W	dirty/clean stuff won't work unless 
	- eject val / (scratch?) is kept freach point
	- can calc color without recalcing iter 
* W	lower priority for drawing threads?
* W	bookmarks
* B	Mutants don't work at deep zooms
* W	plugins
* W	fast single-undo
* B	absolute paths in parameter save files
* B	sometimes all work gets serialized to one thread
* W	preview .fcts in open dialog
* B 	invalid bailfunc # = crash
* W	parameterize buffalo
* W	image size != window size (scrollable)
* W	persistent user prefs, rather than per-fractal
* W	

Movies-
* B	deadlock when render movie while image is being drawn
* B	movies turn off AA
* W	implement frames/image
* W	implement curves
* W	load/save movies
* B	antialiasing/auto-deepen broken for movies
* W 	actually save movie images -> disk
* W	move keyframes up/down 
* W	profile number of threads: is > 2 better?
* B	SMP auto-deepening broken
* B	lines are ugly

Done:
* W	removing mallocing from work queue
* B	Fixed recoloring
* W	Undo/Redo
* W	Online Help
* W	Documentation
* W	Update Screenshots
* B	Sometimes progress=1.0 is left at the end
* W	SMP rendering
* W	pause toolbar -> menu
* W	"deepen now" toolbar button
* B 	deepening black square bug
* B	can't set iterOpts using text entry any more
* W	parameterized types
* B	iter8 incorrect with non-magnitude bailout functions
* B	off-by-one on iter8? (eg 65 iters == 64 iters on previous version)
* W 	Different fractal types
* W	pause
* W	finish cmd-line arguments
* B	annoying precision message
* W	Session remembers last parameters
* B	Applying a colour sometimes moves image: properties not in sync?
* B 	do/undo printfs
* B	*.c -> *.cpp
* B	add docs to distribution
* B	CRASH in quit_cb (changes fract after fract is deleted) if exit 
	after calculation has finished
* W	Deepening...(n iters)
* W	grey undo/redo when not available
* W	create_angle_button : should be a widget
* W	better widget for antialias (slider?)
* W 	get rid of gnomenumberentries
* B	resize more nicely
* B	quit_cb isn't passed the right user_data so it can't interrupt. hmph.
* B	don't resize when toolbar comes/goes
* W	turn on/off auto-deepening
* B	Load/Save 
* B 	about from docs
* W	fractal widget
* W 	sort out sizing!
