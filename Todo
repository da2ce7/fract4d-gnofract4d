GIMP Gradient

The format seems to be
start middle end [range 0...1]
R G B A left endpoint
R G B A right endpoint
type where type is one of linear (0), curved, sine,
sphere_increasing and sphere_decreasing
coloring, one of rgb, hsv_ccw, hsv_cw

The type & colouring are accessible to the gradient editor (the
user, I mean) in the "blending function for segment" and "Colouring 
type for segment" menus of the gradient editor menu.

This information is available in app/gradient.c and
app/gradient_header.h.
