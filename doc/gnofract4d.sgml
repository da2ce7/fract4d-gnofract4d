<title>Introduction</title>

<para>&gf4; is a fractal generation program which can draw some
unusual hybrids between the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. It treats both
fractals as views of the same four-dimensional object and allows you
to explore other views of the same object. </para>

<sect2 id="mset" >
<title>The Mandelbrot Set</title>
<para> The Mandelbrot is defined as the set of all complex numbers
which, when you repeatedly square them and add them again, never
become infinite. In pseudocode, the procedure is:
</para>
<programlisting>
z = 0
while( magnitude(z) &lt; 4.0 )
     z = z^2 + c
</programlisting>

<para>
Here, <emphasis>c</> is determined by the position on screen. This
gives rise to the familiar Mandelbrot set:
<graphic align="center" format="GIF" fileref="mandelbrot_standard"></graphic>

All the points inside the set are (as is traditional) coloured
black. The points outside the set are different colours depending on
how long it takes them to escape from the set. These colours aren't
very mathematically significant, but they look nice.
</para>

<para>
So what happens if <emphasis>z</> is initially set to a complex value
other than zero? Well, you get a rather odd-looking, deformed M-set.
This initial value, which we'll call <emphasis>z0</>, is called the
intial perturbation, and sets which have a non-zero <emphasis>z0</> are
known as <emphasis>perturbed</> sets:
<graphic align="center" format="GIF" fileref="mandelbrot_perturbed"></graphic>
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="julia">
<title>The Julia Set</title>
<para>
The Julia set is actually drawn by the same procedure as the
Mandelbrot set. But instead of changing the value of <emphasis>c</>
for each pixel, we keep <emphasis>c</> constant and change
<emphasis>z0</>. There is a different Julia set for each value of 
<emphasis>c</>; here's the one for <emphasis>c</>=0.
<graphic align="center" format="GIF" fileref="julia_standard"></graphic>
</para>

<para>
Boring, isn't it? That's because we're just squaring the value at each
iteration without adding anything to it. So any value which starts
with a magnitude less than 1 will shrink forever (and hence is a
member of the set). All other values will grow forever, and so we've
just discovered a rather inefficient way of drawing perfect circles.
If we use a different value of <emphasis>c</> we get something more
interesting: 
<graphic align="center" format="GIF" fileref="julia_perturbed"></graphic>
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="julibrot">
<title>The Julibrot</title> 
<para>

Here we come to the heart of the matter. I said above that both the
Julia and Mandelbrot sets are drawn with the <emphasis>same
function</emphasis>. 
<programlisting>
julibrot(z0,c)
z = z0
iterations = 0
while( magnitude(z) &lt; 4.0 and iterations < max_iterations )
     z = z^2 + c
     iterations = iterations + 1
</programlisting>

The Julibrot function has two complex parameters, or four real
ones. In &gf4; I refer to the real parameters as x, y, z, and w: these
are c.re , c.im, z0.re and z0.im respectively.

The only difference is which points we choose to draw. To draw the
Mandelbrot set, we keep <emphasis>z0</> constant and change
<emphasis>c</> with each pixel. To draw the Julia set, we keep
<emphasis>c</> constant and change <emphasis>z0</>. If you squint with
your brain a bit, you can imagine both sets as orthogonal "slices"
through the same four-dimensional object. In &gf4; terms, the
Mandelbrot set is the <emphasis>xy</> plane, and the Julia set is the
<emphasis>zw</> plane. We can also look at other planes: here's an
image of the <emphasis>xw</> plane:
<graphic align="center" format="GIF" fileref="xw_plane"></graphic>
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="viewing">
<title>Viewing in Four Dimensions</title>
<para>
However, we can draw any 2D slice we like, not just those which are
parallel to the Julibrot axes. To do this we'll need to describe our
scene by four things. First, the (<emphasis>x,y,z,w</>) coordinates of
the center of the screen. Second, a vector for the x-axis of the
screen. This tells us how to change the parameters to the Julibrot
function as we proceed across the screen. Third, a vector for the
y-axis. Fourth and finally, the size of the image. For the Mandelbrot
set, our "default" view, the screen is centered at [0,0,0,0], the
x-vector is [1,0,0,0] and the y-vector is [0,1,0,0]. The initial size
is 4, because the whole Mandelbrot set fits inside the 2x2 square. We
can zoom into the set by changing <emphasis>x</> and <emphasis>y</>
and the zoom factor.
</para>
<para>
If we want to draw other slices, we need to rotate our view through
four dimensions. In 3D, we can rotate in 3 directions: around the
<emphasis>x</>, <emphasis>y</>, and <emphasis>z</> axes. In 4D, we
rotate around a <emphasis> plane </> rather than a line, and we can
rotate in 6 directions: around the <emphasis>xy, xz, xw, yz, yw</> and
<emphasis>zw</> planes. For example, if we rotate through 90 degrees
in the xz and yw directions, our screen vectors become [0,0,1,0] and
[0,0,0,1]: in other words, the Julia set. If we rotate only part of
the way, we get a "hybrid" between the two sets, which looks decidedly
odd:

<graphic align="center" format="GIF" fileref="hybrid"></graphic>

In fact, we can rotate to any angle in each of the planes,
creating a whole world of bizarre pictures.
</para>

<sect2 id="hypercomplex">
<title>Hypercomplex Fractals and Quaternions</title>
<para>
There are other kinds of fractal which are commonly described as
"four-dimensional" - hypercomplex and quaternion-based
fractals. &gf4; doesn't currently support these fractals, so they're
only mentioned here to clarify the difference. (If you want to
generate hypercomplex fractals I recommend you try <ulink url="http://www.physcip.uni-stuttgart.de/phy11733/quat_e.html">
Quat</ulink>.) Hypercomplex
numbers have four components (one real and three imaginary) where
complex numbers have two. Since the hypercomplex mandelbrot has two
hypercomplex parameters, in &gf4; terms it's actually an
eight-dimensional object.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="types">
<title>Fractal Types</title>

<para> &gf4; supports a variety of fractal formulae apart from the
vanilla mandelbrot set. These have been pillaged from a variety of
sources, notably <emphasis>Fractint</>. I've tried to keep the names
consistent.
</para>
<para>
The <emphasis>Cubic Mandelbrot</> function calculates z^3 + c, rather
than the standard z^2 +c. The <emphasis>Quadratic</> function
calculates a family of functions of the form A*z^2 - B*z + C*c.
</para>
<para>
The <emphasis>Lambda</> function calculates lambda * z * ( 1 - z). The
complex parameter <emphasis>lambda</> is set by the z and w
parameters, so if lambda is zero, all you'll see is a blank screen.
</para>
<para>
The <emphasis>Barnsley</> fractals originally come from Michael Barnsley's book
<emphasis>Fractals Everywhere</>, though I haven't seen the book and
have copied the implementation from Fractint. 
</para>
<para>
The <emphasis>Burning Ship</> and <emphasis>Buffalo</> fractals are
described on the web page <ulink
url="http://www.theory.org/fracdyn/">http://www.theory.org/fracdyn/</ulink>.
The Burning Ship is essentially a Mandelbrot variant where the real
and imaginary parts of the current point are set to their absolute
values after each iteration, ie z <- (|x| + i |y|)^2 + c. The Buffalo
fractal uses the same method with the function z <- z^2 - z + c,
making it equivalent to the Quadratic type with the "absolute value"
modification.

</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="mouse">
<title>Mouse Functions</title> 

<para>
Clicking with the left mouse button zooms in, making the picture twice
as large as before. The new image is centered on the point where you
clicked the mouse. If you click and drag with the left button, you can
draw a white box around an area. When you let go, the image zooms in
so that the area inside that box fills the window. 
</para>

<para>
Clicking with the right mouse button zooms out, making the picture
twice as small as before. There isn't a click and drag feature for the
right button.
</para>

<para>
Clicking with the middle button rotates by 90 degrees in the
<emphasis>xz</> and <emphasis>yw</> axes. If you're currently looking
at the Mandelbrot set, you'll get a Julia set, and vice versa. If
you're looking at something else, you'll get something weird. Note
that clicking this twice doesn't take you back to where you started:
the screen gets recentered on the point you clicked.
</para> 

</sect1>

<sect1 id="toolbar">
<title>Toolbar buttons</title>
<para>
On the left of the toolbar you can see a small preview window, which
updates as you change the angle or position buttons, to give you an
idea of what the fractal will look like when you release the button.
</para>

<para>
The first eight toolbar buttons correspond to the ten parameters which
define the view. The circular angle buttons, labelled <emphasis>xy</> to
<emphasis>zw</>, can changed by dragging the dot around. When you let
go, the fractal will update. You can see the angle's current value in
degrees in the status bar. By the way, the <emphasis>zw</> angle does
work, you just can't see its effects until you rotate in some other
dimensions first.
</para>
<para>
The square position buttons, <emphasis>xy</> and <emphasis>zw</>, can
be used to alter the view. The <emphasis>xy</> button allows you to
pan around the current view (it doesn't move along the actual
<emphasis>x</> or <emphasis>y</> axes, but along axes relative to the
current view). The <emphasis>zw</> button allows you to move along the
other two axes, resulting in a mutated version of the current image.
Click inside one then drag the mouse, watching the preview window
update, then release the mouse when you like the results.
</para>
<para>
The weird black and white button (OK, so I can't draw) allows you to
increase the current interation count, for those occasions when the
auto-deepening doesn't get it right.
</para>
<para>
The <emphasis>Undo</> and <emphasis>Redo</> buttons should be
fairly obvious. You can undo as many times as you like. Note that undo
also affects parameters such as color, not just position on screen.
</para>

<para>
The <emphasis>Explorer</> mode helps you find neat-looking fractals
easily. It divides the screen into 9 sections; the central section is
the main image - you can click on this to zoom in, or update it as
normal. The other eight images around the edges are "mutant" versions
of the main image - they're formed by starting with the base
parameters and randomly changing them a bit. Whenever you change the
main images, you get a whole new set of mutants. If you like a mutant
more than the main picture, click on it to move it to the middle - it
then becomes the main picture and you get eight new mutants based on
the new main image. To return to normal mode, click the Explorer
button again.
</para>
<para>
The "weirdness slider" determines how different the mutants are from
the standard image. If it's set to 1.0, they're almost unrecognizable
- if it's 0.0, they're exactly the same. You can also generate more
mutants with the refresh button.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="filemenu">
<title>File Menu</title> 
<para>
<guimenuitem>Save Image</guimenuitem> writes the current image to
disk. I recommend using .png images for high quality output, or JPEGs
when image size is important. GIFs are not recommended, since they can
only manage 256 colors.

<guimenuitem>Reset Parameters</guimenuitem> returns you to the
standard view, in case you get lost. <guimenuitem>Reset
Zoom</guimenuitem> zooms out so the picture is four units on a side,
but doesn't reset the other parameters. <guimenuitem>Save
Parameters</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Load
Parameters</guimenuitem> save and load plain-text parameter
description files, so you can return to images in the future.
<guimenuitem>Pause</guimenuitem> temporarily halts the current
calculation, in the unlikely event you have something more important
than generating fractals to do.

<para>
Some fractal types (such as the Quadratic fractal) have additional
parameters which you can set. These are displayed here. What

</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="rendering">
<title>Rendering Section</title>
<para>
This has various options to trade off image quality against rendering time.

<emphasis>Antialiasing</> makes the image smoother and nice looking,
but takes a lot longer to draw (up to five times
longer). <emphasis>Default</> antialiasing is quite a lot faster than
<emphasis>Best</> mode, but can miss some small details.

<emphasis>Max Iterations</> sets the number of iterations a point will
go through before we give up and assume it's a member of the Julibrot.

If <emphasis>Auto Deepening</> is on, the maximum number of iterations
is set automatically by &gf4; but you can change it by hand whenever
you like.

<emphasis> Continuous Potential </> gives a much smoother image, by
basing the color not only on how many iterations the point took to
escape, but on how far away from the origin it ended up on its last iteration.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="bailout">
<title>Bailout Section</title>
<para>
The <emphasis>Bailout Function</> is used to decide whether a point
has left the set. If <emphasis>function(z)</> is greater than the
<emphasis>Distance</>, the point has left the set. A few functions
don't work very well with some fractal types, for example Barnsley
fractals don't mix well with the <emphasis>Or</> bailout function.

</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="image">
<title>Other Sections</title>
<para>
<emphasis>Width</> and <emphasis>Height</> should set the size of the
image in pixels, but for annoying reasons can only
<emphasis>increase</> the size of the image, not shrink it.

The <emphasis>Location</> entryboxes allow you to
change the coordinates of the screen center and the image size. 

The <emphasis>Angles</> tab allows you to set the rotation
angles. Only values between 0 and 2 * pi are different; values outside
this range "wrap" to points inside that range.
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="colors">
<title>Color Browser</title>
<para>
The Color Browser is designed to let you quickly choose a color scheme
which suits the current fractal, by generating a set of previews to
choose between. To update the previews to match the current fractal,
click <emphasis> Refresh</>. To apply a colormap to the main image,
click the map.
