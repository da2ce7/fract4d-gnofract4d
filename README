Gnofract4D: a little fractal generator/browser
--------------------------------------------

Gnofract4D is a descendant of gnofract, by Aurélien Alleaume, 
(mason@multimania.com). Unfortunately, I haven't been able to
contact Aurélien, so I've decided to make the changed program
available separately.  

Gnofract4D's home page is at

	http://gnofract4d.sourceforge.org/
	
Mouse functions:
Click the left mouse button to zoom in, Right button to zoom out, 
and Middle button to flip to the corresponding (quasi-)Julia set.
You can also draw a rectangle with the left mouse button; when you
release the button gnofract4d will zoom into that rectangle. 

Have fun,

Edwin Young
