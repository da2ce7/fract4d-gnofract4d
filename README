About this Program
==================

Gnofract 4D is a program for drawing beautiful mathematically-based
images known as fractals. See the manual for more details.

Examples, screenshots etc are at http://edyoung.github.io/gnofract4d

Basic Installation
==================

Run:

 ./setup.py build

If you would like a copy of the manual:

./createdocs.py

You can then run Gnofract4D in the local directory:

./gnofract4d

You can also install it (you'll normally need to be root to do this):

./setup.py install

You can then run it as:

gnofract4d

You can verify that your installation is working correctly by running

./test.py

Requirements
============

Gnofract 4D requires these packages to run:

o Python version 3.5 or higher
o GTK version 3.18 or higher
o A C++ compiler (used at runtime to compile your fractal formulas)

To build from source you also need:
o headers for libpng and libjpeg (on Ubuntu, install libpng-dev and libjpeg=dev)
o Python headers (python3-dev)
o Pkg-Config (pkg-config)

Ubuntu 16.04 or newer releases should work.

If you're not sure if you have these or not, just try running
"./setup.py build" and see if it complains.

If FFmpeg is installed it will be possible to create videos.
