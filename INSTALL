Basic Installation
==================

Run:

 ./setup.py build

You can then run Gnofract4D in the local directory:

./gnofract4d

You can also install it (you'll normally need to be root to do this):

./setup.py install

You can then run it as:

gnofract4d

Requirements
============

Gnofract 4D requires:

o Python version 2.2 or higher
o PyGTK version 1.99 or higher
o GTK+ version 2.0 or higher

If you're not sure if you have these or not, just try running
"./setup.py build" and see if it complains.
